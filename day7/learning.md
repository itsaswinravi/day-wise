## we learnt the below 

- `ls` - will list all the files and folders in the current directory (folder)
    - it will not work in cmd, it will only work in powershell

- `cd <folder name>` it will enter into the folder
- `cd ..` - it will come one folder back
    - cd means `change directory`

- `code ..` will open the previous folder in vs code
- `code .\day-wise\day3\   `
